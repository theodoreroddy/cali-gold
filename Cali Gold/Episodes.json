  "description": "It's like stepping back in time. A glimpse of what life was like in California during the 1920s, 30s and 40s. And this look back is made even more fascinating because it is from the Japanese-American perspective through the medium of home movies! In this special one-hour edition of \"California's Gold,\" host Huell Howser visits with Karen Ishizuka, the senior curator of the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles for a first-hand look at these remarkable movies. Karen is responsible for gathering these movies together from all over California -- seldom seen movies that document in a simple, yet profound way the everyday lives of Japanese Americans. Also included in this program is a poignant 40-minute film entitled: \"Something Strong Within,\" made entirely of home movies shot inside the internment camps that Japanese Americans were forced into during World War II. What these movies from the camps reveal in their elegant, un-narrated silence, is a proud people struggling to maintain a sense of normalcy in a very difficult situation. The entire one-hour special is entitled simply: \"Japanese American Home Movies.\" Not only do these movies serve as documents of a people's history, but are also rich examples of \"California's Gold.",

Before it closed down for good in 1976, it also held the distinction of being the largest, richest mine California has ever known, processing over $700,000,000 in metallic wealth. New Almaden Mine was situated in the Santa Clara Valley near San Jose and in its heyday was bustling with activity with a mix of miners from Mexico to Cornwall. And the surprise is -- this was not a gold mine. It was a quicksilver mine! Quicksilver (mercury) was absolutely essential in hard rock mining because it was used to separate the gold from the rock it was found in. The fact that the New Almaden Mine was already in operation when gold was discovered in our state only quickened the pace of the gold rush itself. Today, the town is a registered National Historic Landmark and the mine itself is on land which is part of a county park.

  "description": "California is full of them. They are located in both fresh and salt water. Some are big and some are small. And they're all part of our state's rich geological and human history.  We're talking about rocks in the water! And in this episode host Huell Howser visits three of the most fascinating of these rocks. First, Huell travels to scenic Lake Tahoe and boards a boat to Emerald Bay where he climbs all over Fannette Island, the only island in the entire lake. A sparsely-timbered, brush-covered upthrust of granite that rises 150 feet above the turquoise water, this island is believed to be a resistant rib of rock which was overridden by the glacial ice that carved out Emerald Bay. But the payoff comes when Huell reaches the very top of the rock and visits the historic stone \"tea house\" built in 1928 and hears about its colorful history.  Next Huell travels to the very northern coast of California to see first hand some of the most unusual rocks you'll ever see in the water. They're part of the jetty system built to protect ship traffic in and out of Humbolt Bay. These huge, reinforced concrete shapes resembling children's toy jacks, are 15 feet high and 43 tons each, with two eight-sided arms and an eight-sided connecting beam. This unique assemblage of rocks is the only design ever to hold up under the constant pounding of the heavy seas, and Huell not only walks out on the jetty for a close-up look, but is taken out to sea by the U.S. Coast Guard for an exciting view from the ocean side.  Huell's final destination is the most unusual because he ends up in the Mojave Desert -- far from any water, fresh or salt -- and what he finds on the desert floor are rocks that you'd never even notice under normal circumstances, but were once under water and, in fact, have a rich human story to tell.",

No other mountains on this continent rise so high so fast - in slightly less than seven horizontal miles, the peak rises from 800 to 10,804 feet above sea level!  But these mountains hold another distinction as well. They are the site of two of the greatest engineering accomplishments ever attempted by man.  In this adventure, host Huell Howser first visits the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway which takes passengers from the warm desert floor to a snowy alpine environment in a matter of minutes. This tramway which opened in 1963 was constructed on such a sharp slope that it was impossible to build roads, and the only way to construct it was by helicopter. In fact, the construction of the tramway was such an engineering challenge that it has been labeled \"the 8th wonder of the world,\" and has been designated a historical civil engineering landmark.  Huell continues his adventure by traveling to the base of the San Jacinto Mountains for a journey that is both historic and truly exciting. This trip takes him through a 13-mile tunnel dug through the mountains during the 1930s as part of the Colorado River Aqueduct which brought water to Southern California. This huge and extremely complicated engineering project still ranks as one of the most difficult ever attempted. The 16-foot tall tunnel usually flows with 1.2 billion gallons of water a day, but once every five or ten years the water is cut off for a day or so to allow an inspection. Huell takes advantage of this opportunity to explore the tunnel and also to make some unusual discoveries once inside.

  "description": "They come in all shapes and sizes and many date back to the early part of this century. All have been lovingly restored by their owners and are meticulously maintained. In short, they're some of the most beautiful wooden boats ever made. Host Huell Howser gets a close look at these boats as he attends the 24th annual Concours d' Elegance which is dedicated to the preservation and celebration of the wooden boats that have graced Lake Tahoe since the 1920s. He not only talks with the owners about the rich history of their individual boats, but goes out on the clear waters of Lake Tahoe for a ride on some of the fastest boats. It's all part of Wooden Boat Week sponsored by the Tahoe Yacht Club, and after you see these spectacular boats for yourself, you'll agree they are very much a part of \"California's Gold.",

  "description": "The California desert has always been a place filled with mystery ... and surprises! When you travel through our desert you're never sure what you're gonna see, who you're gonna meet, or what strange and wonderful experiences you're gonna have. Huell Howser discovered that first hand on a recent trip to the Salton Sea community of Niland. At first glance, Niland is a sleepy little agricultural town once known as a major grower of tomatoes. But a few miles out of town -- out in the middle of nowhere -- Huell discovered two honest-to-goodness, little-known pieces of \"California's Gold.\" First Huell visits with self-taught artist and desert character Leonard Knight and gets a tour of \"Salvation Mountain,\" a huge multicolored mosaic of scripture, flowers, trees and the American flag all sculpted into the side of a mountain with adobe, straw, and as much bright paint as Leonard can lay his hands on. \"Salvation Mountain\" is an on-going labor of love that Leonard started ten years ago and he shares his enthusiasm and his mountain with Huell. About a half mile down the road, Huell next visits a town that is like no other in our state. Everyone lives rent free. There are no landlords, no official rules and there are no utilities or houses, yet over 3,000 people call it home during the winter months. It's called \"Slab City\" and it sits on the sight of an old abandoned Marine Base. Its citizens are a hearty bunch of independent, self-sufficient folks who have turned this desolate, yet beautiful part of the desert into an unofficial RV park. Huell spends a day touring \"Slab City\" in a twenty-five year old dune buggy, meets many of its colorful residents, and finds out why so many of them keep coming back year after year. It's a real desert adventure as Huell Howser goes way off the beaten track to find two fine examples of \"California's Gold.",

  "description": "The morning of April 12, 1859 started like most other mornings for the miners working the Willard Claim on the West Branch of the Feather River just across the canyon from Dogtown. The men were hard at work washing the mountain away with the force of water pressure using the hydraulic mining technique. Then, as Chauncy Wright, one of the hired hands, bent over to pick up what he at first considered to be just another rock, he made a discovery that would end up in the record books. Because on that morning, Chauncy and his fellow miners uncovered a 54 pound gold nugget! Needless to say, word quickly spread and the community of Dogtown celebrated the momentous discovery for several days. And as producer/host Huell Howser discovers in this adventure, the celebration is still going on ! Huell and cameraman Luis Fuerte travel to the town of Paradise, just down the road from Dogtown in Butte County, for the annual Gold Nugget Days Celebration, complete with a parade and all sorts of community festivities. The local citizens also take him to the actual area where the huge nugget was found - an area where modern-day miners are still searching for gold. There's also an E Clampus Vitus Donkey Derby and a visit to the Gold Nugget Museum included in this adventure. An adventure in search of an honest-to-goodness big piece of California's Gold.",

However, many people are under the false impression that they're stubborn, while others tend to overlook them in favor of the more glamorous horse. But, once a year the good citizens of Bishop, California, in the Sierra Nevada, set aside an entire week to pay tribute to... the mule. Often regarded as one of nature's oddities, a mule is a hybrid animal that results from crossing a mare (female horse) with a jack (male donkey). They come in literally all shapes and sizes, and during Bishop's Mule Days Celebration there's a mule parade, mule races and all sorts of mule competitions. Thousands of people come from all over California to have a good time and to pay tribute to this animal. Host Huell Howser and cameraman Luis Fuerte join in the celebration of this rather remarkable animal which, over the years, has very much proven itself to be a fine example of California's Gold",

  "description": "Some people like it -- to others, it's a nuisance. Something \"to come in out of.\" But like it or not, everyone would agree it's been a part of the history of California since the very beginning. We're talking about wind. And on this particular adventure, host Huell Howser goes in search of some of the most historic and strongest wind around.  First stop is the back lot of the famous Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank where Huell takes a look at some wind machines used in movie production, and learns they've been a part of our movie legacy since the very early silent films. The special-effects people even crank up some of the machines for a demonstration of just how much force they can create.  Then it's on to Pasadena for a visit to the campus of the California Institute of Technology. Tucked away in one of the buildings is the GALCIT Ten-Foot Wind Tunnel which has been operating since 1930 and used to test everything from aircraft to automobiles. It's a huge tunnel and of course Huell couldn't resist not only climbing around inside, but getting a dose of wind as well!  The last windy stop is in Northern California at the Point Reyes National Seashore-- a place not only filled with spectacular natural beauty, but a lot of natural wind as well. In fact, Point Reyes has the distinction of being the windiest place in the entire state, and even though it was a fairly calm day, Huell definitely got the feel of why it's in the record books!  At first, it seems like a rather obscure subject, but after thinking about it, and especially after visiting these three locations, there's not doubt about it -- wind is a fine example of California's Gold.",

Also included is a look at a farming operation in the Salinas Valley that grows hundreds of acres of cacti for human consumption. \"This all happened in a spontaneous way,\" explains Howser. \"We'd literally spot these interesting places as we drove by, stop our car and start asking questions.\" The result of these stops and these questions is an unplanned episode made up entirely of \"Bits and Pieces\" of California's Gold.",

With the advent of the missile age in the 1950s, the land was transferred to the U.S Air Force for use as a missile training base. The first missile was launched from this facility in 1958 and since then almost 2,000 missiles and space boosters have followed suit.  Located on our state's central coast near the town of Lompoc, Vandenberg AFB is not only the U.S. Air Force's third largest installation, but an important part of our state's and nation's space history.  In this episode of \"California's Gold,\" host Huell Howser visits Vandenberg for a first-hand look at this huge base which covers over 98,000 acres and is literally filled with reminders and remnants of our space heritage.  Huell is taken on a tour that includes stops at sites of the first satellite launches from California, and an early Thor missile launch facility that is now listed as a National Historic Landmark because it is one of the best and most intact surviving examples of 1950s space technology. Huell also visits Altas missile sites, an underground Titan missile site and the Space and Missile Heritage Center filled with space and missile artifacts.  The adventure ends with a look at some of the state-of-the-art facilities and hardware which today are making history and breaking new ground in the space field. Vandenberg AFB continues to be an important and, in fact, vital part of our space program and, as we discover on this visit, it is also a fine example of \"California's Gold.",

  "description": "Sunny beaches and swaying palm trees are very much a part of what California is all about. So are snow and ice.  And to prove it, host Huell Howser and camerman Luis Fuerte bundle up and travel to one of the coldest places in our state in search of historic snow and ice.  They find it first in a lake near Truckee in Nevada County. Today, ice is part of a readily-accessible and plentiful part of our daily lives. But not long ago the only ice available came from lakes and ponds where it was produced by the natural cold of winter, then hand-cut with giant saws and shipped to waiting cutomers.  On this particular adventure Huell meets up with historian Tom Macaulay who takes him to a frozen lake in the Sierra and actually demonstrates how ice was harvested years ago. It's a fascinating look back in time to something most of us never knew existed -- the California ice industry.  Then Huell jumps aboard a train for a ride from Sacramento to Reno, Nevada -- a journey through some of the toughest and most scenic terrain in our state. During the winter months there is so much snow in this area that, years ago, the railroads had to construct \"snow sheds\" to cover and protect the tracks. These huge, wooden sheds covered almost the entire length of the track in the higher elevations of the Sierra and, literally, were responsible for keeping the trains running. Today, modern snow removal equipment has made the sheds obsolete, but Huell manages to find and walk through one of the last remaining portions of a historic wooden snow shed -- a structure that is very much a part of California's Gold.",

To ride on this boat is to step back in time -- in fact, the Delta Queen has been declared a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. But true riverboat buffs will tell you that the Delta Queen was not originally built to travel on the Mississippi River. It's a California boat, built in Stockton in the late 1920's for service on the Sacramento River. The Delta Queen spent the first 20 years of her life as a night-boat taking passengers back and forth from Sacramento to San Francisco and becoming a familiar and much-loved part of the California landscape. In 1947, the proud paddlewheeler left California, was towed through the Panama Canal and began her service on the Mississippi River. Now, 50 years later, producer/host Huell Howser travels over 2,000 miles east to rediscover the Delta Queen's California history and roots.

The luxurious Pan American\"Clipper\" planes of the 1930's took cargo, mail and passengers aroundthe world in what was, for its time, considered a daring and pioneering feat. Pan American's Treasure Island terminal and lagoon became the home port forthe Clipper's Pacific operations -- connecting the United States with the FarEast by air. Starting in the mid-1930s, and lasting for only five years,residents of the Bay Area were treated to the sights and sounds of these hugeboat planes taking off and heading out over the Pacific. Recently in a very special episode of \"California's Gold,\" historyrepeated itself as, once again, a boat plane landed on the Bay, taxied up to adocking area near Treasure Island, took on passengers and flew out over thecity. This episode is a tribute to the \"China Clipper\" and itsCalifornia connection. The original Terminal building on Treasure Island is the stage where formerPan American pilots and crew members who actually flew the Clipper, gather oncemore for conversation and reminiscing. Producer/host, Huell Howser experienceshis high point when he climbs aboard one of these historic boat planes with twoformer crew members for a short, exciting flight around the Bay area. The days of the Clipper are gone forever, replaced decades ago by long-rangejets. But for a few hours on a beautiful spring afternoon, some of the glorydays of the great Clipper ships, and the people who made those days happen,returned to Treasure Island.

Several hundred people who had traveled from a far away land in search of opportunities in this new state called California. They worked on ranches and farms and built the railroads. They ran small shops and stores and raised families. And then gradually over the years they disappeared, but thanks to historians, archeologists and members of the Chinese community, the history and accomplishments of these early Chinese pioneers are being uncovered -- literally.  In this very special episode of \"California's Gold\" Huell travels to San Luis Obispo. There he meets Howard Louis, son of the legendary Ah Louis who ran the main store in Chinatown. Howard is full of stories and gives Huell a tour of the store which is the only Chinatown structure left standing. Huell also is treated to a Lion dance outside the store put on by the Chinese students from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and listens as a musician plays the music those early Chinese settlers would have played in the 1800's. The day also includes a visit to the local historical museum for a look at 100 year old glass plate images made of the Chinese residents at the time. Then we watch as volunteers sift through tons of earth taken from the original Chinatown location and discover wonderful bits and pieces of the life that went on there.

  "title": "Citrus",
  "description": "Citrus was to southern California what the discovery of gold was to the north because it triggered a massive migration to our state. In fact, many Americans from back east came to California to see for themselves the \"paradise\" found on those early crate labels used to promote citrus fruit. Through these labels, \"California sunshine\" and \"California living\" became deeply ingrained in the popular imagination of a nation. In this episode of \"California's Gold,\" host Huell Howser explores the history and lore of orange crate labels with Gordon McClelland who's not only written a book on the subject, but has a collection containing literally thousands of the colorful labels, along with orange postcards and other ephemera. Huell learns first-hand not only how the labels were designed and printed, but just how important they were in the marketing of California oranges around the world. Then Huell travels to UC Riverside to visit the Citrus Variety Collection which covers 20 acres, has approximately 1,700 trees and over 800 different varieties of citrus from all over the world. It's an amazing place which has been part of the California landscape since the early 1900's performing valuable research and coming up with all sorts of new varieties of citrus. Huell walks through the groves and picks and tastes some of the newest and most unusual varieties of oranges being grown. All in all, this adventures is a juicy slice of history as we take a look at our state's citrus industry which is very much a part of \"California's Gold.",

  "title": "Arrowhead Springs",
  "description": "It appears on the southern slope of the San Bernardino Mountains. Over the years it has been the subject of a host of Indian legends. In fact, no other natural landmark in those mountains has been regarded with such awe and wonder. We're referring to the \"Arrowhead,\" a near-perfect natural 7 1/2 acre arrowhead-shaped landmark formed by the contrast of light and dark vegetation which has been clearly visible for hundreds, possibly thousands, of years. In this adventure, Huell Howser and cameraman Luis Fuerte not only travel to the famous Arrowhead itself, but also visit the once world-famous Arrowhead Springs Hotel which was one of the favorite hideouts for Hollywood stars back in the 1940's and 1950's. This entire area is known for its many hot springs and, in fact, water rushes everywhere, from flowing fountains to gurgling springs. Twenty-nine springs are located here, some cold and some as hot as 196 degrees! These hot springs, which hold the record of being the hottest in the world, heat the mineral baths, the almost forgotten \"steam caves\" located underneath the old hotel, and the cabana pool which was built for Olympic and film star Esther Williams in 1944. The beauty of the area and the hot springs themselves have made this a popular destination since the days of the earliest Indian communities. It's a place filled with natural and human history and a perfect place to find lots of \"California's Gold.",

  "title": "Shasta Dam",
  "description": "When most people think of Shasta Lake, they imagine themselves on a houseboat enjoying California's largest manmade reservoir. With 365 miles of shoreline it is a boaters paradise. What most people don't think about is the massive structure that is responsible for holding back the water that creates Shasta Lake. We're talking about Shasta Dam which, is a perfect example of \"California's Gold\". Construction of the dam started in 1938 and ended in 1945. It's 602 feet high, 883 feet thick at the bottom, 30 feet thick at the top, and 3,460 feet long. The face of the dam is as big as six football fields and the spillway is the largest manmade waterfall in the world - three times the height of Niagara Falls. There are 18 outlets on the face of the dam, each big enough to drive a pickup through. Shasta Dam has the second largest mass of any dam in the United States. In this adventure, Huell and Luis get a behind the scenes look at this engineering marvel. Miles of tunnels and millions of gallons of water make for an exciting day, but there is another aspect to the Shasta Dam - the human element. It is the people who built the dam, the people that poured concrete 24 hours a day for 5 1/2 years and the countless other jobs that make this structure such a gem. Huell meets several of the original dam workers and listens to their stories about the glory days of Shasta Dam.",

  "description": "Many of us who have flown into San Francisco have noticed huge ponds filled with water that ranges in color from deep red to light pink. We decided that we just had to get to the bottom of this California mystery. When we finally arrived at the \"ponds\" we found one of California's most unique agricultures. Salt and brine shrimp are what is responsible for our crimson ponds. 300,000 tons of salt a year to be exact. Salt has been harvested from these ponds since the Gold Rush and has been a very important part of our states history. Cargill Salt has to be one of the strangest and most beautiful places we have been, and here are a few of the things we found: salt stacks 90 feet high and 880 feet long, hundreds of salt ponds called crystallizers that average 20 to 40 acres in size and one of the few private railroads in the U.S. With over 14,000 different uses for salt, it is a treat to see where it all comes from.

Over a million people every year take the ferry through the thick San Francisco fog to walk the cellblocks that housed the likes of Machine Gun Kelley and Al Capone. As usual Huell wasn't satisfied with the regular tour and went in search of the \"Hidden Alcatraz\". It got it's name from the Spanish word Alcatraces, or Bird Island and didn't see human inhabitants until the US Military took it over in the mid 1800s. During the Civil War it was used as a prison for Southern privateers. After the more modern prison was built in the 1930s , the old Civil War prison was covered over and virtually forgotten. Join Huell and Luis as they go under Alcatraz and discover the labyrinth of tunnels and caves that honeycomb \"The Rock\". The remnants of our state's rich history are finally uncovered in this very special tour. There is much more to Alcatraz than meets the eye.",

With full medical care, housing, day care and 24 hour meals, it was the model of efficiency and the forerunner of Kaiser Permanente. In our March episode of California's Gold, Huell and Luis visit the site of the Kaiser Shipyard and talk with people who worked there throughout the war, including some \"Rosie the Riveters\" who took the place of the many men who were overseas. As a special treat we follow one of the original Victory ships that was built at the shipyard as it returns home. The SS Red Oak Victory was saved by the city of Richmond and towed out of the Naval Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay down to its new home where it will be restored and used as a museum.

Surfing has played a major role in the \"California\" lifestyle and has a rich and colorful history up and down our coast. One of the most famous and historic is San Onofre Beach in San Diego County. Surfing got it's start in Polynesia over three thousand years ago and Hawaiian's have been riding waves for over one thousand. Surfing arrived in California in 1907 and has been a passion of Californians ever since. Many of our states early surfing pioneers cut their chops on the famous waves at San Onofre Beach. Huell meets and reminisces with several members of the San Onofre Surfing Club and gets an inside look at California surfing history and beach culture. We'll meet the old timers and the new breed who call San Onofre home. So grab your ukulele and your surf board and hop in your Woody for a trip to the beach with Huell.",

  "title": "Things That Come Back",
  "description": "At one time Tulare Lake was the largest freshwater lake west of the Great Lakes. In the 1930s farmers choked off the four major rivers that fed the lake and it quickly dried up. Once the home to millions of birds and herds of tule elk and antelope, the lake bed is now covered in agriculture. But like all things great in California, the lake refuses to disappear completely. During very heavy winters, the lake partially re-fills with water and stops motorists in their tracks as they come across a huge lake amongst the vineyards and orchards that fill the valley. Huell and Luis take a very special canoe ride in this magical lake. Anybody who has studied California history knows the name James Marshall and his discovery of gold which sparked the beginning of the gold rush. Does the name Jenny Wimmer ring a bell? Probably not, but she played a major role in Marshall's discovery. Jenny Wimmer cooked for and took care of twenty men who worked at Sutters Fort including James Marshall. When Marshall reached down into the tailrace of the mill and picked up a small shiny nugget, it was Jenny Wimmer he went to for conformation. Jenny had done quite a bit of mining and knew how to test for gold in a lye bucket she used for making soap. Huell and Luis travel back to Coloma to re-create that historic moment. As an special treat, the actual \"Wimmer Nugget\" comes home for the day as does many of Jenny's descendants.",

Between San Diego and Arizona is some of the most treacherous countryside in the US With a bevy of workman and a lot of dynamite they managed to snake their way to Arizona. The railroad had many tunnels collapse over the years, especially in the Carrizo Gorge. The railroad decided to build the Goat Canyon Trestle in 1932 after a series of tunnel closures. The Goat canyon Trestle is one of the most impressive feats of engineering in the world. Huell, Luis and a handful of ex-railroad employees hop on a 1932 Model A railbus and work their way to the now unused trestle. The Goat Canyon Trestle is the highest existing curved wooden trestle in the U.S. Huell takes a close look at this marvel from the top to the bottom. Men who worked on the line reminisce about the trestle and the wonder of its size and beauty. This tour is not for those with a fear of heights.",

Muscle Beach started as a WPA project in 1934 and helped spawn the modern fitness movement that lives on today. The original Muscle Beach was a plot of sand just south of Santa Monica Pier. In the beginning it wasn't about muscles, it was about fitness and fun. Men and women did somersaults and handstands, built human towers and threw each other around. Huell and Luis go back to the original plot of sand to visit with some of the men and women who made Muscle Beach their playground during its heyday. We'll see some wonderful old photos and home movies and hear some great stories. This show has a particularly good ending as there a group of people who are bringing back the original Muscle Beach in it's original spot.

What most people don't realize is that California's rich wine history got it's start in southern California. In this grape filled adventure, Huell travels to one of the oldest winery's in California. The Guasti family established their winery in 1904 and at one time had 4,000 acres of grapes in the Rancho Cucamonga area. A virtual town was built to house the employees and their families. It had its own school, firehouse, inn, church, and post office. In 1917 Guasti was the largest winery in the world. As a special treat, Huell attends a \"Guasti\" reunion filled with ex-employees and their families that had lived and worked at the winery throughout it's history.

But one of the strangest and most popular attractions has been the Flying Fish Boat Trip which has been transporting visitors on nighttime journeys to watch Catalina's flying fish since the turn of the century. In 1924 William Wrigley decided to build a boat just for Flying Fish Tours. The Blanche W. is a 64-foot long open-deck wooden boat named after Wrigley's granddaughter Blanche. The boat is still outfitted with its original pew-style mahogany benches, which seats 98 passengers. The boat cruises the islands coastline at night, attracting flying fish with two 40-million candle-power W.W.I spotlights. The spectacle of the fish leaping out of the water has been compared to giant silver dragonflies soaring over the ocean. Huell travels back to Catalina for a very special 75th anniversary cruise. William Wrigley's granddaughter Blanche (for whom the boat was named) comes back to the island and shares some wonderful stories with Huell. We'll even take a close up look at a flying fish and enjoy a wonderful night on the sea.",

A 12 acre flower flag was their way of saying thanks to all the Americans who were fighting the good fight. The company planted \"flags\" in 1942, '43, '45 and 1952. In a fitting tribute to an obscure piece of California history, the town of Lompoc decided the flower flag was a wonderful image for their annual Mural-in-a-Day event as part of the Old Town Faire.

Not only did they use the flesh for food; they used the mother of pearl shells for their crafts. Huell visits a very early midden pile in Pt. Lobos State Reserve and learns about its history. The Japanese were the firsts to harvest abalone commercially in California and were diving for them as early as the turn of the century. Huell visits the site of one of the early Japanese abalone canneries. As a special treat, we go into Monterey Bay to watch as one of the original divers go for a dive in an authentic 1930's suit.

An English sailor by the name of Jack Swan completed his saloon/boarding house in 1847 and very quickly US soldiers stationed in Monterey where putting on shows in his building. The building went through many incarnations over the years until 1937 when it was re-opened as a theater. The Troupers of the Gold Coast (the oldest continually performing theatrical company in the world) have been entertaining audiences ever since. Huell gets a tour and sees a performance in California's first first theater. Next its off to Sacramento to California's second first theater, the Eagle Theater. Mr. Zadock Hubbard and Mr. Gates Brown, owners of the Round Tent Saloon located on J Street near the corner of Front Street, financed the construction of the Eagle Theater in 1849, to provide entertainment for the hordes of miners and emigrants coming to Sacramento during the Gold Rush. Construction began in July and the building was completed by September 1849. Huell gets a wonderful tour and again we get to see a performance on a very historic stage.",

Mudpots only occur in three places in the U.S. and one of them is right here in California. Our first stop is the Imperial Wildlife Area. Huell and a member of the Fish and Game take a look at huge mounds of bubbling, oozing, popping and exploding mudpots. This is a public area that is open to mud lovers one and all. Next, it's off to some privately owned land which has some extraordinary mudpots. Photographer Jack Hobart has made some amazing images with still and video cameras over the years at this secret spot which he shares with Huell.",

As the 19th century came to a close in San Francisco, a movement some say a real estate scheme began to remove all buried remains from within the city. After many ordinances, acts and decrees, cemeteries were carefully relocated to nearby towns, while headstones were recycled as breakwaters and paving material. Only three cemeteries and their inhabitants were left within the boundaries of San Francisco. Join Huell as he discovers the sacred grounds that still exist today at San Francisco de Asis (Mission Dolores) and the San Francisco National Cemetery at the Presidio.

Huell travels to Petaluma to attend the annual Butter and Egg Days celebration, which ran from 1916 to 1928 and was brought back in the early eighties. Petaluma pulls out all the stops in this wonderful small town gathering. You won't want to miss the Cutest Chick costume contest. Continuing our look at Historic Chickens, the Petaluma Historical Society takes Huell to one of original chicken farms that once lined the hills of this town. Beautiful moss covered chicken coups are slowly decaying, but are an integral part of Petaluma's landscape. Several of the original farmers come back to spend a day remising about their lives on these farms.

For legal reasons, the project never worked and the reservoir became a recreational area. What most people don't know is that there is a whole world under the lake. Huell takes a hundred-foot ride down in an elevator that was built in the late 1800s to explore this underwater marvel. Believe it or not there is a 3000 foot tunnel that runs under the lake and lots of wonderful old equipment, including pumps, engines and valves originally built for irrigation purposes that is hidden away.

  "title": "The Emperor and the President",
  "description": "Like other states, the hierarchy of California's government begins with our Governor and weaves its way down through offices such as Secretary of State, Attorney General and Senator. What is surprising about California, is that we once had an Emperor and a President. California's President William Ide emerged during the 24 days of the Bear Flag revolt of 1846. Ide posted a proclamation in Sonoma declaring liberty for California settlers, which set the stage for California's statehood. In admiration of his bravery and leadership, his fellow Bear Flaggers and other pioneers dubbed him President. Later in the 19th Century, a wealthy businessman who had lost a huge fortune, walked into the office of the San Francisco Bulletin and proclaimed himself Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico. From 1859 until his death in 1880, the eccentric Emperor Norton continued to issue proclamations, circulate his own currency and roam the streets of San Francisco dressed in a Civil War uniform. Residents and business owners humored the loveable character by paying him \"taxes,\" providing him with meals and transportation, and saluting him. Although their titles are unofficial, Huell discovers that the legacy of our Emperor and President continues as he visits the locales frequented by Emperor Norton in San Francisco, Sonoma and the popular adobe named for President Ide in Red Bluff. Huell also pays tribute at both of their gravesites, permanent reminders of their contribution to California.",

The family loved the place so much that Will had a proper ranch built and the family moved there in 1928. In 1944 after the death of Mrs. Rogers, the property became Will Rogers State Historic Park and is now a well loved tourist destination. The ranch has been perfectly maintained and is filled with all of the Rogers family original furnishings and memorabilia. It’s like stepping back into Will's boots. What makes Huell's tour so special, is that its given by Will’s last remaining child Jimmie Rogers.

Despite being a great success for a few years (so much so that a second windmill was built), by 1913 electric pumps were introduced, so the windmills began to become obsolete. In August 1976 volunteers from the US Navy Reserve started work on restoring the Dutch Mill. Work continued through to completion in 1981. The second windmill, which is lose by, is patiently waiting its turn to be brought back to its original glory.

  "description": "As we all know, California has some spectacular scenery and our great variety of Trees make up a large part of it. In this adventure, Huell visits three big trees that are a great example of California's Gold.  First Huell travels to Santa Barbara to see the Moreton Bay Fig Tree. Given to a little girl as a gift from an Australian seaman, the sapling was planted in 1876. That little sapling is now the largest Moreton Bay Fig in the continental U.S. The tree is 42 feet around its base, 80 feet tall and has a branch spread of 176 feet.  Next its off to Temecula and the former ranch of Erle Stanley Gardner, author of the Perry Mason Novels. On this spot stands the largest California Live Oak in the world. It stands 96 feet tall, with a trunk circumference of 20 feet and a branch spread of 590 feet. It is estimated to be at least 800 years old. This tree is so big that most people think it is a grove of trees.  We end the show in Kings Canyon National Park at the General Grant Tree. This tree is the third largest tree in the world. It stands 267 feet tall and is 2000 years old. What makes this tree so special is that it is our nations official Christmas tree. The tree was officially dedicated on April 28, 1926 by President Calvin Coolidge. Ever since 1926, people from the community and visitors from around the world have trekked to the tree at Christmas time to celebrate our nation and the spirit of the holidays.",

Besides a thriving wine industry, significant mission history and the distinction of being on the Butterfield Stage route, Temecula was also home to Erle Stanley Gardner. The lawyer-turned-writer, best known for bringing Perry Mason to life through novels, radio, film and television settled in Temecula on a 3,000-acre ranch he dubbed \"Rancho del Paisano.\" Remaining there from 1937 until his death in 1970, he was an inexhaustible writer sometimes dictating 5,000 words to one of his four secretaries before breakfast. He also indulged his outdoorsman spirit by exploring the rugged ranch with his dogs. Join Huell as he strolls the grounds of the former home of Erle Stanley Gardner accompanied by a longtime ranch manager, one of Gardner's secretaries and Gardner's 99-year-old widow, Jean.",

By the 1940s, pollution in the bay and urbanization nearby had destroyed most of the island's hunting and fishing. Today, Drawbridge is a ghost town of gray, weathered buildings sinking into the bay, and is part of the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge.

Huell tours the barn and hears stories of Disney’s passion for trains which many people say fueled his vision for his theme parks. Then, after hearing there are only three barns like it left standing in California, Huell visits the historic Octagon Barn in San Luis Obispo. Locals estimate that it is more than 100 years old and was built as a livery stable and later used as a dairy barn. Although it is showing its age, the Land Conservancy of San Luis Obispo County is spearheading an effort to refurbish the Octagon Barn as a roadside vegetable stand for use by local farmers.",

At last, we travel to Duck Lake on horseback to witness the trout as they drop from the plane. Before the advent of the airplane, trout were “planted” in hundreds of California Lakes by horseback-- a difficult task that would take an entire summer to complete. In 1947, the Department of Fish and Game began using airplanes to complete the task and even employed WWII pilots whose skills as bomber pilots were put to a new use.",

It was here that Commodore Jon Drake Sloat raised the American flag in July of 1846, claiming over 600,000 square miles of territory for the US. This territory later was included in all or portions of the states of Utah, Colorado, Arizona, California and New Mexico. This building is recognized as the oldest government building in California and it is State Historic landmark #1. Wander through this adobe building and find it as it looked in the 1840s. Try guessing to what purpose the items on display were used for. Is Sebastian the parrot real? Gaze out from the upper room where custom agents and soldiers once stayed. Watch for ships arriving from sea, much as the custom’s officials did over 150 years ago. Next, Huell stumbles upon the tallest bridge in California. Located on Foresthill Road in Placer County near historic Highway 49, The Foresthill Bridge was built to span a lake that never arrived from the damming of the American River in Auburn. And then Huell wanders right into the town of Cool and enjoys a visit to the local beauty salon and meets the mayor!",

General Phineas Banning drove the first stage through the treacherous mountain pass in 1854. In 1863 troops under the command of General Beale deepened “the cut” to its present depth of 90 ft. In 1910 the old roadway was replaced by the nearby Newhall Tunnel, which gave way to modern-day Sierra Highway in 1938. Santa Clarita Valley Historian Philip Scorsa tells Huell all there is to know, including how Beal’s Cut lived on as a movie location for decades to come. Then, it’s onto Groveland, CA. a quirky Gold Rush community with Native American roots. Huell gets a tour with Innkeeper Peggy Mosley and sees the sights, including: “The Iron Door” – known as the oldest continuously operating saloon in the west. Groveland is also the headquarters for the Hetch Hetchy project, and gateway to Yosemite National Park.",

When they see a wave they run towards it with their skimboard still in hand. Upon reaching the wet sand they drop the board and jump onto it as quickly as possible. Once on the board, the skimmer must remain as stable as possible and prepare to make the transition to the ocean. The skimmer then (hopefully) glides out into the ocean toward the oncoming wave, banks off of it, and rides it back into shore. Huell travels to Laguna to watch some locals show how its done.",

Clark, an unmatched visionary of his time, accomplished the near impossible by constructing the world-class Norconian Resort in a remote area of Southern California. The Norconian was an immediate success and frequented by the rich elite and Hollywood's finest. Unfortunately, the Club never made a nickel as the Stock Market crash and subsequent economic depression forced Clark to give up his dream after a ten year fight. The story didn't end there. The fabulous resort was converted into one of the pre-eminent Naval Hospitals in the United States; a facility that treated survivors of Pearl Harbor and pioneered the use of Penicillin, the polio vaccine and state of the art rehabilitation techniques. Subsequently, one of the finest Naval Weapons Testing sites in the Nation and the California Rehabilitation Center, the first state funded addict treatment center in the country, called the old resort home; adding to the Norconian's rich and fabulous history. Huell travels to the site with Kevin Bash who is a filmmaker and historian to see this faded but beautiful structure in all its glory.",

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Obama described Occidental as “a wonderful, small liberal arts college. The professors were diverse and inspiring. I ended up making some lifelong friendships there, and those first two years really helped me grow up.” Who knew that the next president of the United States had such a formative connection to California? Well I sure didn't! Join me as I get the Presidential tour of Occidental College in Eagle Rock, where Barack Obama spent his Freshman and Sophomore years. We'll visit his dorm room, talk to some of his old professors, and learn how his two years there helped to shape him.",

  "description": "Huell traces the history of the S.S. Catalina, which carried 24 million passengers to-and-from Catalina Island from 1924 to 1975. Considered by many to be the West Coast's most storied vessel, the S.S. Catalina fell into disrepair while docked at Ensenada and efforts to rescue and restore the legendary ship ultimately failed. It was dismantled and scrapped. Today, some of the ship's original signs, doors, and benches decorate the home of Coos Bay resident Dave Engholm, whose love for the S.S. Catalina led he and his family into a remarkable restoration project.",
